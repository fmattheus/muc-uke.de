#### MUC Uke-Alongs
Once a month, we come together for a fun-filled evening of ukulele playing—usually at Kulturzentrum Giesinger Bahnhof, though sometimes we switch things up and meet at other great locations.
Each event has a special theme, like "80s Hits" or "Songs About Air," so there’s always something new to play. Lyrics and chords are projected on a big screen, so everyone can follow along easily.
What You Need to Know:
- Bring your ukulele if you have one!
- Don’t own one yet? Let us know in advance, and we’ll bring a guest ukulele for you to borrow.
- A quick note: While we welcome all ukulele lovers, this isn’t a beginner’s course. It’s best if you already know a few basic chords and can strum along before joining us.
- Leading a Song - We encourage members of our community to lead songs during our meetups! Here’s how it works:
  - We announce the theme for the next gathering on Meetup.
  - Members suggest songs that fit the theme.
  - We choose songs based on theme fit, playability, and popularity.
  - If your song is selected, you’ll be invited to a run-through session to get it MUC-ready!
If you’re new to MUC, we recommend attending at least one event before leading a song. Also keep in mind—it’s not an open mic or a solo performance. Your role is to guide the group and make sure everyone enjoys playing together.
Admission: Free! But we do ask for a small donation (around €2) to help keep things going.

#### Acoustic Meetups
For a more relaxed experience, we also arrange acoustic gatherings at Rumpler or scenic outdoor spots like the Isar or local parks. These informal sessions are a great way to connect and enjoy music in a laid-back setting.

#### MUC All Stars – Perform with Us!
From time to time, we’re invited to perform at public events. For these occasions, we have a special performance group called the MUC All Stars.
