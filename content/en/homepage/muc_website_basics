# Welcome
Do you enjoy playing music together with others, than the Munich Ukulele Collective is for you.  We are a group that regularly gets together to have fun playing ukuleles.

# Events
## Main Event
We get together monthly to play together. Usually at the Kulturzentrum Giesinger Bahnhof and also occassionally at other locations.
Each event has a different theme for the songs selected.  For example "80s music", or songs about "air".  That keeps the songs fresh.  The lyrics as well as the chords to play are displayed on a big screen so that everyone can play and sing along.
If you already have an ukulele, please bring it along.  If you don't have one, let us know, and we can bring a guest ukulele that you can use for the evening.  Do keep in mind though, that we are not focussed on complete beginners.  It's best to have a basic understanding of the "normal" chords and know how to strum before coming.
You'll notice that we have many people that lead the songs.  Anyone from our community is welcome to lead a song as well.  After the theme of the upcoming event is published on https://www.meetup.com/munchen-ukulele-meetup/ , we have a round of song suggestions by community members.  These songs are then filtered out based on certain criteria like "adherence to theme", "ease of playing", "popularity".  And if the song passes the filtering, you are asked to come to the audition, so we help make the song MUC ready.  Generally it's preferred if you only lead a song after haven been to at least one MUC event.  Also, please keep in mind this is not an open mic where the focus is on your talents, rather your job on this evening is to make sure the community has fun playing along with your song.
Admission is free, but we do request a minimal donation of around 2 Euros.
